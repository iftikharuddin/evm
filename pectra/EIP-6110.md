# What's EIP-6110? 🎯
EIP-6110 provides validator deposits as a list of deposit operations added to the Execution Layer block

### The Problem
Right now, when someone wants to become a validator:
- It's a slow process (can take up to 12 hours!)
- Uses a complex voting system
- Has some security risks
- Makes things complicated for developers

### The Solution
Move validator deposits to a simpler system:
- Handle everything in the Execution Layer (where transactions happen)
- No more need for complex voting
- Faster processing of new validators

### How It Works 🔄
1. **Simpler Process**
   - Deposits get processed right in the block
   - No more waiting for votes
   - Everything happens automatically

2. **Benefits**
   - Much faster (no more 12-hour waits)
   - More secure
   - Easier for developers to work with
   - Less can go wrong

Think of it like upgrading from a committee-approved bank deposit to an instant deposit at an ATM - faster, simpler, and more reliable! 🏦
