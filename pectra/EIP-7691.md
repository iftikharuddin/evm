# EIP-7691
EIP-7691 increases the number of blobs to reach a new target and max of 6 and 9 blobs per block respectively

Imagine Ethereum as a delivery service:
- "Blobs" are like shipping containers
- Currently, each delivery truck (block) can carry up to 3 containers
- Layer 2 solutions (rollups) use these containers to ship their data

What's the Problem?
- 3 containers per truck isn't enough anymore
- Lots of packages are waiting to be delivered
- The long-term solution (bigger trucks) isn't ready yet

What's the Solution?
EIP-7691 suggests:
- Allowing up to 9 containers per truck (maximum blobs)
- Aiming for 6 containers per truck (target blobs)
- Adjusting shipping prices (base fees) to match the new capacity

Think of it like this:
- Current situation: ğŸš›(ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦)
- Proposed change: ğŸš›(ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦) with room for 3 more

Possible Concerns:
1. Some roads (networks) might be too narrow for bigger trucks
2. Shipping prices might get weird at first
3. Some delivery drivers (validators) might need time to adjust

But don't worry! They're:
- Testing the bigger trucks carefully
- Watching to make sure everything runs smoothly
- Making changes slowly to avoid any delivery chaos

This is just a temporary fix until they can build bigger and better roads (long-term scaling solutions).
