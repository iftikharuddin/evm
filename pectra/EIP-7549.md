# EIP7549
EIP-7549 moves committee index outside of the signed Attestation message

# What's EIP-7549? 🎯

### The Problem
- Right now, similar votes need separate signatures
- Takes up more space
- Makes things slower and more expensive
- Like having to sign the same letter multiple times just because it's going to different people

### The Fix ✨
1. **Main Change**
   - Move one small piece of data (committee index) outside
   - Makes similar votes use the same signature
   - Like using one signature for multiple copies of the same letter

2. **Benefits**
   - 62x more efficient (from 1,366 to just 22 checks!)
   - Can handle 4x more votes per block
   - Network works better during busy times

### Safety 🛡️
- Bad actors can't mess with the system
- Signatures still check everything
- Small adjustment period when updated

Think of it like upgrading from individual signatures to a stamp that works on multiple copies - simpler and faster, but just as secure! 🚀
