# EIP-2935

EIP-2935 stores and serves last 8192 block hashes as storage slots of a system contract to allow for stateless execution

## What's EIP-2935? ðŸ“¦

### The Problem
- Ethereum needs to remember recent block history
- Right now, each node has to store this info themselves
- This makes things heavy and complicated

### The Solution
- Create a special contract that stores the last 8,191 block hashes
- Like having a shared history book everyone can read from
- Instead of everyone keeping their own copy

### How It Works
1. **Storage**
   - Works like a circular notebook
   - When new block comes, writes it down
   - When notebook is full, starts over from beginning
   - Keeps last ~8,191 blocks (about 1.5 days of history)

### Benefits ðŸŽ¯
- Makes Ethereum lighter to run
- Easier to check historical data
- Helps with Layer 2 solutions
- Makes everything more efficient

Think of it like moving from everyone keeping their own diary to having one shared library that everyone can access! ðŸ“š
