# EIP-7685
EIP-7685 introduces a general purpose bus for sharing EL triggered requests with the CL

Imagine Ethereum as a two-story building:
- Ground floor: Execution Layer (EL) - where smart contracts live
- Upper floor: Consensus Layer (CL) - where validators manage the network

Currently, if someone on the ground floor (a smart contract) needs something from upstairs (like validator management), they need to send a messenger (an intermediary) up and down the stairs. This is inefficient and risky - what if the messenger makes a mistake?

EIP-7685 proposes installing a secure "mailbox system" between the floors:
1. Smart contracts can put requests in special "mailboxes" (the requests field)
2. Each request has two parts:
   - A label saying what kind of request it is (request_type)
   - The actual message (request_data)
3. All requests get sorted and sealed into a package (requests_hash)
4. The upstairs team (CL) can then process these requests directly

Think of it like upgrading from using human messengers to installing a secure pneumatic tube system between floors - it's faster, more secure, and removes the middleman.

The main benefits are:
- Direct communication between floors
- Less reliance on external messengers
- Better security through standardization
- Flexibility for future upgrades
