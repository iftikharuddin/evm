# EIP-7840
EIP-7840 includes a per-fork blob parameters in client configuration files

Think of Ethereum's blobs (data packages) like luggage on an airplane:
- Each "fork" (network upgrade) might have different rules about how many bags are allowed
- Pilots (consensus layer) and ground crew (execution layer) need to know these limits

Current Problem:
- Ground crew has to keep asking pilots about luggage limits
- This constant back-and-forth is slow and inefficient
- It's like calling the pilot for every single bag!

EIP-7840's Solution:
- Create a simple "rulebook" (configuration file) that lists bag limits for each flight (fork)
- Example:
  ```
  Cancun flight: target 3 bags, max 6 bags
  Prague flight: target 6 bags, max 9 bags
  ```
- Now both pilots and ground crew can just check the rulebook instead of talking to each other

Benefits:
1. Fewer phone calls between crew members (less API communication)
2. Clear rules written down in one place
3. If rules aren't specified for a new flight, use the last flight's rules

The only real risk is if someone forgets to update the rulebook, but that's easier to manage than constant radio chatter!
