# EIP-7702
EIP-7702 adds a new tx type that permanently sets the code for an EOA

Think of your Ethereum account (EOA) like a basic debit card. Right now, it can only do simple things - send money and tokens. But what if you could upgrade it to a "smart" card with more features?

That's what EIP-7702 does! It lets you:
1. Turn your basic account into a programmable one
2. Set rules for how it can be used
3. Let others help manage it (safely)

Here's a real-world example:
- Current situation: You have to manually approve every single transaction
- With EIP-7702: You could set rules like "let my trusted friend send up to 0.1 ETH per day" or "automatically approve trusted DeFi protocols"

How it works:
1. You send a special transaction (type 0x04) saying "I want to upgrade my account"
2. You set specific rules (like who can do what)
3. Your account becomes smarter while staying under your control

The Risks:
1. If you set bad rules, someone might misuse your account
2. Some existing contracts might get confused by the new behavior
3. Bad actors might try to abuse the system

Think of it like upgrading from a simple key to a smart home system:
- More convenient? Yes! 
- More features? Definitely!
- Needs careful setup? Absolutely!
