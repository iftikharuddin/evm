# EIP-7623
EIP-7623 increases calldata cost to reduce maximum block size

Think of Ethereum blocks like shipping containers on a cargo ship. Currently, some containers (blocks) can get really stuffed with data, making them heavy and inefficient to transport. This happens mainly because rollups (layer 2 solutions) are putting lots of data on Ethereum.

EIP-7623 basically suggests:

1. Making it more expensive to send large amounts of data in a single transaction
2. Setting a "minimum shipping cost" for data-heavy packages
3. Keeping regular transaction costs the same for normal users

The main goal is to limit block sizes to about 0.72 MB (compressed). It's like saying "if you want to ship a really big package, you'll need to pay premium rates."

The clever part is how it does this. Instead of just raising prices across the board, it introduces a floor price for data (TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN = 10). If you're sending a normal transaction, you won't notice any change. But if you're sending a data-heavy transaction, you'll need to pay more.

One interesting real-world parallel: It's similar to how shipping companies charge differently for oversized packages versus regular mail. Regular letters (normal transactions) stay cheap, while huge packages (data-heavy transactions) cost more per unit of size.

The timing of this EIP is particularly important because Ethereum is preparing for EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), which will introduce a new way to handle large amounts of data. This EIP helps ensure the transition will be smooth by better aligning the costs of different data storage methods.
