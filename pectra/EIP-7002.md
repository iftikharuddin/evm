# EIP-7002
EIP-7002 allows validators to trigger exits and partial withdrawals via their execution layer (0x01) withdrawal credentials

Let me explain EIP-7002 super simply:

# What's This About? ðŸŽ¯

Currently:
- Validators need special "hot" keys to withdraw their staked ETH
- If they lose these keys = can't get their money
- If someone else manages these keys = no control

# The Fix ðŸ”§

This EIP lets validators:
- Use their regular ETH wallet to withdraw
- No need for special keys
- Take back control of their funds

# How It Works ðŸš€

1. Want your ETH back?
   - Submit request
   - Pay fee
   - Wait in line (2 withdrawals per block)
   - Get your ETH!

2. Safety Features:
   - Queue system prevents spam
   - Fees go up when busy
   - Everything happens in order

That's it! Makes withdrawing staked ETH easier and safer. ðŸ’ª
