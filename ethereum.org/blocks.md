# Blocks

Think of a block like a container full of transactions that happens every 12 seconds. Here's what makes them special:

1. They're like a chain of containers - each block points back to the previous one through a special code (hash). This creates a continuous chain that can't be tampered with.

2. Why use blocks? It's like everyone agreeing on what happened and in what order. Instead of processing transactions one by one, Ethereum processes them in batches (blocks) every 12 seconds. This helps keep everything synchronized.

3. Who creates blocks? Special participants called "validators" who have put up 32 ETH as collateral. It's like putting down a security deposit to prove they'll behave honestly. One validator is randomly chosen every 12 seconds to create the next block.

4. What's in a block? Each block contains:
   - A bunch of transactions
   - Information about who created it
   - A link to the previous block
   - Various technical details to keep the network running smoothly

5. Block size: Blocks can't be infinitely large - they have a limit on how much stuff they can contain. This is measured in "gas" and helps ensure that the network doesn't get overwhelmed.

The cool thing about this system is that once a block is added to the chain, it's extremely difficult to change it because you'd have to change all the blocks that came after it too. This makes Ethereum very secure and reliable.

Think of it like adding pages to a book - once you write a page and add more pages after it, it becomes very obvious if someone tries to change an earlier page because all the page numbers and references would be wrong!

#### Note:

Even though transaction requests occur dozens of times per second, blocks are only created and committed on Ethereum once every twelve seconds.
