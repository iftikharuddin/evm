# Networks

Ethereum networks are essentially groups of computers that communicate using the Ethereum protocol. Here's a breakdown of the main types:

1. Public Networks:
- Mainnet: The primary Ethereum network where real value transactions happen
- Testnets (Testing Networks):
   - Sepolia: Currently recommended for testing applications and smart contracts
   - Goerli: Used for testing staking and validating (being phased out)
   - Layer 2 Testnets: Including Arbitrum Goerli, Optimistic Goerli, and Starknet Goerli

2. Private Networks:
- Development Networks: Local networks for testing applications before deployment
- Consortium Networks: Private networks controlled by specific trusted nodes (like academic institutions)

Key Points about Testnets:
- Perfect for testing without using real money
- Get test ETH from "faucets" (web apps that give free test ETH)
- Your Ethereum account works across networks, but balances don't transfer
- For security, it's recommended to use different accounts for testnet and mainnet

Important Update for Developers:
- Sepolia is now the recommended testnet for application development
- Goerli is being deprecated and will be replaced by Holesovice in 2023
- Each testnet has specific faucets and resources available
