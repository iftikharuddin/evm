# Proof of work
Proof of Work (PoW) system and how it evolved! ðŸ˜Š

1. What Was Proof of Work?
- Like a really hard math puzzle competition
- Miners competed to solve complex problems
- Winner got to add new blocks and earn rewards
- Required lots of computer power and energy
- Was used until September 2022 (now uses PoS)

2. How Mining Worked:
- Miners tried to find a special number (nonce)
- Had to process lots of data using algorithms:
  * First used Dagger-Hashimoto (research version)
  * Then used Ethash (final version)
  * Needed 4GB+ of RAM to store data
- First to solve got to create the block

3. Mining Challenges:
- Used massive amounts of energy
- Needed expensive specialized equipment
- Mining pools could dominate (centralization risk)
- High environmental impact
- High entry barriers for new miners

4. Benefits It Had:
- Well-tested security (used by Bitcoin too)
- Didn't need ETH to start (unlike PoS)
- Simple to implement
- Proven track record

5. Why Ethereum Changed:
- PoS is more energy efficient
- Better for decentralization
- More secure against attacks
- Allows for more technical improvements
- More environmentally friendly

This is all historical now since Ethereum uses Proof of Stake, but it's interesting to understand how it evolved!
