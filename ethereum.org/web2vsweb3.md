# Break down Web2 vs Web3 in the simplest way possible

Web2 (Current Internet):
- Think Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
- Companies own and control everything
- You give personal data to use services
- Can be shut down by companies
- Like having a landlord for your digital home

Web3 (Blockchain Internet):
- No single company in control
- Like owning your digital home
- Pay with crypto (like ETH)
- Can't be shut down or censored
- Your data stays yours

Real-World Examples:
1. Twitter (Web2):
   - Twitter can delete your tweets
   - Can ban your account
   - Servers can crash

   Web3 Twitter:
   - No one can delete your tweets
   - Can't ban you
   - Always online

2. Payment Apps (Web2):
   - Need your personal info
   - Can block your payments
   - Company controls everything

   Web3 Payments:
   - No personal info needed
   - No one can block payments
   - You control your money

Challenges of Web3:
- Can be slower
- More complicated to use
- More expensive sometimes
- Needs special software

Think of it like this:
- Web2 is like a shopping mall (owned by someone, they make the rules)
- Web3 is like a public park (owned by everyone, community rules)
