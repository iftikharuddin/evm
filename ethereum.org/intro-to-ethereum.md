# Intro to Ethereum

Think of Ethereum like a giant, global computer that everyone shares:

1. **The Basics**
- It's like a huge digital ledger that everyone can see
- It runs on many computers (nodes) around the world
- Everything that happens needs to be agreed upon by these computers

2. **ETH (Ether)**
- It's like the fuel for this global computer
- You need it to do anything on Ethereum
- Think of it as "digital money" that also powers the network

3. **Smart Contracts**
Think of these like digital vending machines:
- Put in some ETH
- Get something in return
- They run automatically
- No one can tamper with them
- e.g A game, marketplace, or financial app

4. **How It Works**
- Transactions get bundled into "blocks"
- Blocks get chained together (hence "blockchain")
- Can't change old blocks without breaking the chain
- Everything is verified by "validators" who stake ETH as collateral

5. **The Cool Part**
- No single person controls it
- Can't be shut down
- Runs 24/7
- Anyone can use it
- Can't be censored or changed without network agreement

Think of it like:
- A world computer 🖥️
- That's always on 🔌
- Anyone can use it 👥
- Uses ETH for fuel ⛽
- Runs unstoppable programs (smart contracts) 🤖
