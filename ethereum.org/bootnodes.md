# Introduction to Ethereum Bootnodes

Think of joining the Ethereum network like moving to a new city. When you first arrive, you need someone to help you meet other people and learn your way around. In Ethereum, bootnodes are like these helpful locals who introduce newcomers to others in the network.

Here's what makes bootnodes special:

1. First Contact: When a new Ethereum node (like your computer running Ethereum software) starts up, it needs to find other computers in the network. Bootnodes are the first computers it contacts.

2. One-time Helpers: Unlike regular connections, bootnodes are only used when you're first joining or need to find new connections. It's like using a welcome center when you first visit a city - you don't need to go back once you know your way around.

3. Public Availability: Bootnodes are always publicly accessible. They're like information kiosks that anyone can walk up to and get help from.

Running your own bootnode is possible - it's like volunteering to be that helpful local for others. You just need:
- A computer that's always online
- A public internet address (no private network)
- Enough bandwidth to handle many connections

The Ethereum Foundation maintains official bootnodes, but anyone can run one. Just remember to always include at least one official bootnode in your list to stay safe - it's like having one trusted local guide among your contacts.
