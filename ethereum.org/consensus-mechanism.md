# Consensus mechanisms

Think of consensus like a group of friends deciding where to eat:

1. Basic Concept:
- Consensus just means "everyone agreeing on something"
- In Ethereum, it means nodes (computers in the network) agreeing on which transactions actually happened and in what order
- At least 66% of the network needs to agree for things to work

2. Current System: Proof of Stake (PoS)
- It's like putting down a deposit to become a restaurant reviewer
- People put up ETH as a deposit (stake) to become validators
- If they review honestly (validate correctly), they earn rewards
- If they lie (validate dishonestly), they lose their deposit
- This makes it very expensive to try to attack the network

3. The Old System: Proof of Work (PoW)
- Was like a math puzzle competition
- Computers raced to solve hard math problems
- Winner got to add new transactions to the blockchain
- Required tons of energy and computing power
- Ethereum doesn't use this anymore!

4. Why This Matters:
- Keeps everyone honest
- Makes sure your transactions are safe
- Prevents people from cheating or spending the same money twice
- Makes the network secure without needing a central authority

Think of it like a really secure digital ledger where everyone can check that everything is correct, but nobody can cheat the system unless they're willing to lose a huge amount of money!
