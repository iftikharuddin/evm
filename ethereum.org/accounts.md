# Accounts

Think of Ethereum accounts like two types of bank accounts:

1. Personal Accounts (EOA - Externally Owned Accounts):
- Like your personal bank account
- Has a special password (private key)
- Can send money and start transactions
- Free to create
- Think: Your digital wallet

2. Business Accounts (Contract Accounts):
- Like a business account with special rules
- Runs on computer code (smart contracts)
- Can only do things when someone interacts with it
- Costs money to create
- Think: Vending machine that runs on code

What both can do:
- Hold ETH (money) and tokens
- Send/receive funds
- Work with smart contracts

Important Parts:
- Balance: How much ETH you have
- Address: Like your account number (starts with 0x)
- Nonce: Keeps track of your transactions
- Storage: Where account data is kept

Cool Fact:
Your private key is like your ATM PIN but way more secure:
- Shows you own the account
- Signs your transactions
- Must be kept super secret!

Think of it this way:
- Private key = Your house key
- Public address = Your house address
- Anyone can send stuff to your address
- Only you can access it with your key

Both EOA (user accounts) and Smart Contract accounts have the exact same format:
- Both start with "0x"
- Both are 42 characters long
- Both are hexadecimal addresses

Examples:
- EOA: `0x5e97870f263700f46aa00d967821199b9bc5a120`
- Contract: `0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d`

The main difference is how they're created:
- EOA addresses: Come from private keys
- Contract addresses: Come from:
  1. Creator's address
  2. Number of transactions (nonce)

Think of it like this:
- EOAs are like personal mailboxes (created with keys)
- Smart Contracts are like business mailboxes (created when deployed)
- Both look identical from the outside! üì¨

Fun fact: You can't tell if an address is an EOA or smart contract just by looking at it - you need to check if there's code associated with it on the blockchain! üîç
