# Node Architecture

Think of an Ethereum node like a computer system with three main parts:

1. Execution Client (The Transaction Handler):
- Processes transactions
- Runs the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- Manages account balances
- Where you interact with Ethereum (like sending transactions)
- Think of it as your "banking app interface"

2. Consensus Client (The Coordinator):
- Keeps everyone in sync
- Receives and shares new blocks
- Makes sure everyone follows the right chain
- Think of it as a "traffic controller"

3. Validator (Optional Extra):
- Needs 32 ETH staked
- Proposes new blocks
- Confirms other blocks
- Can earn or lose ETH
- Think of it as a "security guard"

How They Work Together:
- Execution Client: "Here are the transactions"
- Consensus Client: "Let's make sure everyone agrees"
- Validator: "I'll help create and verify blocks"

Important Change:
Before: Only needed Execution Client
Now due to PoS: Need both Execution + Consensus Clients
Optional: Add Validator if you want to stake

Each part has its own network to talk to other nodes, kind of like having separate phone lines for different conversations. They work together to keep Ethereum running smoothly and securely.

This system helps make sure everyone has the same, accurate copy of transactions while keeping the network secure and decentralized.
