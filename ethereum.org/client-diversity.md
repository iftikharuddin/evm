# Client diversity
Think of Ethereum like a huge global network of computers (nodes) all working together. Each computer needs to run software (a client) to participate in the network. Here's why having different types of clients matters:

The Current Situation:
- Too many people are using the same software
- For execution layer (handling transactions): Geth is used by about 85% of nodes
- For consensus layer (network agreement): Prysm is used by about 60% of nodes

Why This is a Problem:
1. Single Point of Failure
- Like having everyone in a city using the same type of lock on their doors
- If someone finds a problem with that lock, every house becomes vulnerable

2. Network Safety
- If a bug affects the most popular client:
  - With Consensus clients: A bug affecting 33% could stop transactions from being confirmed
  - With Execution clients: A bug could cause wrong transactions to be processed
  - Worst case: A bug affecting 67% could cause major network problems and loss of funds

The Solution:
- Use different clients more evenly across the network
- Ideally, no single client should be used by more than 33% of the network

Available Clients:
1. Execution Clients:
- Besu
- Nethermind
- Erigon
- Go-Ethereum (Geth)

2. Consensus Clients:
- Nimbus
- Lighthouse
- Teku
- Lodestar
- Prysm
- Grandine

The Big Message:
- Running less popular clients helps make Ethereum stronger
- It's like diversifying investments - don't put all eggs in one basket
- The network becomes stronger when people use different clients more evenly

This diversity is unique to Ethereum and makes it more resilient than other blockchains that rely on just one client.
