# Intro to ETHER

**What is ETH?**
Think of ETH like digital fuel â›½:
- It's the official currency of Ethereum
- You need it to do anything on the network
- Like gas for your car, but for digital transactions

**How ETH Works:**
1. **Paying for Stuff**
- Want to send money? Need ETH
- Want to use an app? Need ETH
- Want to trade NFTs? Need ETH
- These fees are called "gas fees" 

2. **Creating New ETH**
- New ETH is created as rewards for validators
- Validators are like digital security guards
- They stake their own ETH as collateral to keep the network safe

3. **Burning ETH**
- Every transaction burns (destroys) some ETH
- Like burning fuel in your car
- This helps keep the system balanced

4. **ETH Sizes**
Think of it like money:
- ETH = dollars
- Gwei = cents
- Wei = tiny fractions of cents
