Pectra is Ethereum's next big upgrade coming in early 2025, following the Dencun upgrade from March 2024. Think of it as a significant software update that makes Ethereum better.

# Main Goals
1. Fix Problems: Sort out performance bottlenecks
2. Make Things Better: Improve experience for users and validators
3. Future-Proof: Prepare for bigger upgrades coming later

# Cool New Features

### Smart Accounts Made Easy (EIP-7702)
