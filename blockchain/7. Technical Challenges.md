# Technical Challenges

The lecture, given at MIT, discusses the key challenges facing blockchain technology:

**Performance and Scalability Issues:**
- Current transaction speeds are extremely limited (Bitcoin: 7-10 per second, Ethereum: around 20 per second)
- Traditional financial systems like Visa handle 20,000-30,000 transactions per second
- Energy consumption is significant - Bitcoin uses approximately 1/3 of 1% of global electricity

**Privacy and Security Concerns:**
- Regulatory tension between transparency requirements and privacy needs
- Privacy coins (like Z-cash, co-created by MIT's Medoras) use zero-knowledge proofs to maintain privacy
- Private key custody presents unique challenges for institutions and individuals

**Interoperability Challenges:**
- Connecting blockchain systems to traditional financial infrastructure
- Linking different blockchain networks together
- Handling software updates that aren't backward-compatible (leading to hard forks)

**Governance and Collective Action Problems:**
- The lecturer considers these the most difficult challenges to solve
- How to achieve consensus on updates and changes to the protocol
- Chicken-and-egg problem of adoption requiring widespread use

**Possible Solutions Being Explored:**
- Layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network to handle more transactions off-chain
- Alternative consensus protocols beyond proof-of-work
- Side chains and sharding to improve scalability
- Zero-knowledge proofs to balance transparency and privacy

The lecturer predicts scalability, efficiency, and privacy challenges can be solved over the next 3-10 years but believes governance issues will remain the most challenging aspect of blockchain technology.

### Lightning Network Simplified

The Lightning Network is a "Layer 2" solution that works on top of Bitcoin. It creates payment channels between users where they can transact quickly and cheaply without recording each transaction on the main blockchain. 

Only two transactions hit the main blockchain: opening a channel (which locks funds) and closing a channel (which settles the final balance). During the channel's life, users exchange digitally signed balance updates between themselves. Payments can route through multiple channels, allowing you to pay anyone on the network. 

This system dramatically reduces blockchain congestion while maintaining security through cryptographic guarantees and economic incentives.
