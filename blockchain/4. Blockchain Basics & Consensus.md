# 4. Blockchain Basics & Consensus
This lecture about blockchain and mining in an easy-to-understand way:

1. Byzantine Generals Problem:
- This is a classic problem about how different parties (like generals) can coordinate and reach agreement when some participants might be malicious or communications might fail
- The challenge is getting everyone to agree on a single plan (attack or retreat) without a central authority

2. Proof of Work Solution:
- Bitcoin uses something called "proof of work" to solve this coordination problem
- It's based on a concept developed by Adam Back in 1997 for fighting email spam
- The key idea is making participants solve difficult computational puzzles that:
  - Are hard to solve (takes lots of computing power)
  - But easy to verify once solved
  - Use "leading zeros" in hash functions as the puzzle

3. Mining Evolution:
- Started with regular computer processors (CPUs) in 2009
- Moved to graphics cards (GPUs) in 2010 for faster processing
- Now uses specialized hardware called ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits)
- Mining has become much more difficult - about 7 trillion times harder than in 2009
- Now requires massive mining operations with thousands of machines and cooling systems

4. Mining Pools:
- Miners group together in "pools" because finding blocks alone is too rare
- Pool operators provide services to miners for a 1-3% fee
- Helps smooth out the revenue for individual miners
- Different pools control different percentages of total mining power

5. Native Currency (Bitcoin):
- Created as an incentive system for miners
- Has built-in "monetary policy" limiting supply
- Currently creates 12.5 new bitcoins per block (about $75,000-80,000 worth)
- Has a 4.1% inflation rate that will decrease over time
- Will eventually cap at 21 million total bitcoins

6. Network Types:
- Full nodes: Store and validate the complete blockchain
- Pruning nodes: Remove old validated transactions to save space
- Lightweight nodes: Only store block headers, rely on full nodes for verification
- Miners: Don't need to be full nodes, can rely on pool operators
- Memory pool: Stores unconfirmed but validated transactions

The lecture shows how Bitcoin combines cryptography, economic incentives, and network design to create a decentralized system that can reach consensus without requiring trust in any central authority.
