# 3. Blockchain Basics & Cryptography
Comprehensive summary of this lecture focusing on cryptographic and blockchain fundamentals:

Key Technical Concepts:

1. Cryptographic Foundations:
- Two main cryptographic primitives:
  * Hash functions
  * Digital signatures/asymmetric cryptography
- Both enable secure communications and computations in presence of adversaries

2. Hash Functions:
- Core properties:
  * Maps input of any size to fixed output size
  * Deterministic (same input always produces same output)
  * Efficiently computable
  * Pre-image resistant (one-way function)
  * Collision resistant (infeasible for different inputs to produce same output) 
  * Puzzle friendly

3. Block Structure:
- Headers contain:
  * Version number
  * Previous block hash
  * Merkle root (transaction summary)
  * Timestamp
  * Difficulty target
  * Nonce (random number used once)

4. Digital Signatures:
- Based on public/private key pairs
- Three key functions:
  * Key pair generation (requires good random number generation)
  * Signature creation (using private key)
  * Signature verification (using public key)
- Infeasible to derive private key from public key

Critical Security Considerations:

1. System Security:
- Not absolutely immutable, but computationally infeasible to break
- Quantum computing poses potential future threat
- Multiple hash functions used for added security
- Random number generation quality critical for key security

2. Implementation Vulnerabilities:
- Many crypto companies have poor cybersecurity practices
- Wallet security often compromised by weak random number generation
- Private key protection essential
- Software update challenges in decentralized systems

3. Structural Elements:
- Full nodes vs light nodes (different data storage requirements)
- Block headers ~60MB vs full blockchain ~180GB
- Network of approximately 10,000 nodes globally
- Transaction verification through Merkle trees

Practical Applications & Limitations:

1. Mining Considerations:
- Current block reward: 12.5 BTC (~$80,000)
- Requires electricity costs around $0.03/kWh to be profitable
- Mining pools dominate due to high computational requirements
- Geographic concentration in areas with cheap electricity

2. Technical Evolution:
- Block time: Bitcoin 10 minutes vs others (Ethereum ~7 seconds)
- Block size can contain 1000-2000 transactions
- Scalability vs security tradeoffs
- Importance of software update consensus

Security Researcher Notes:

1. Critical Areas for Analysis:
- Random number generation implementation
- Private key management systems
- Node security and distribution
- Mining pool centralization risks
- Transaction verification mechanisms

2. Research Priorities:
- Cryptographic primitive implementation
- Network communication security
- Consensus mechanism vulnerabilities
- Wallet security architecture
- Update mechanism security

3. Future Considerations:
- Quantum computing impact
- Scaling solutions security
- Cross-chain interaction risks
- Mining centralization threats
- Software update governance

This lecture provides essential foundational knowledge for understanding blockchain security and implementation considerations. Security researchers should particularly focus on the cryptographic primitives, their implementation, and the various attack vectors possible at different system levels.
