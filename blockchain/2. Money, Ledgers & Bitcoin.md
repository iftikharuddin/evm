# 2. Money, Ledgers & Bitcoin
Summary of this lecture focusing on the history and fundamentals of money, ledgers, and their relationship to blockchain:

Key Concepts:

1. History of Money:
- Started with physical items (sawed bores in Ethiopia, Cowie shells in West Africa)
- Evolved to metallic coins, then paper money
- Originated from either barter systems or ledger/credit systems (debated)
- Paper money initially started as warehouse receipts in China
- Early bankers were often goldsmiths who issued paper receipts

2. Ledgers:
- Core characteristics:
  * Immutable (cannot be changed)
  * Time-stamped
  * Records transactions/counterparties
  * Accurate
  * Valid/verifiable
- Types:
  * Transaction vs. Balance ledgers
  * General ledger vs. Sub-ledgers
  * Single-entry vs. Double-entry bookkeeping

3. Fiat Currency:
- Represents central bank liabilities
- Based on social and economic consensus
- Not backed by physical commodities (post-gold standard)
- Legal tender for all debts, public and private
- Integrated with banking system ledgers

4. Banking System Structure:
- Central bank at top (master ledger)
- Commercial banks below (sub-ledgers)
- Transactions between banks require central bank ledger adjustments
- Growing cash circulation despite digital alternatives

5. Payment Systems Evolution:
- Negotiable orders (checks) - declining usage
- Credit cards (1950s onwards)
- Digital/mobile money
- Key elements: signature, payee, amount, account numbers, timestamps

6. Characteristics of Good Money:
- Durable
- Portable
- Divisible
- Uniform and fungible
- Acceptable
- Stable
- Hard to mine/create

7. Digital Money Development:
- Early attempts failed due to:
  * Centralization issues
  * Double-spend problems
  * Lack of merchant adoption
  * Consensus challenges
- Success stories:
  * PayPal (1998)
  * M-Pesa in Kenya
  * Alipay
  * Starbucks payment system

8. Modern Money Categories:
- Token-based vs. Account-based
- Physical vs. Digital
- Private vs. Central
- Wholesale vs. Retail

9. Important Historical Context:
- Double-entry bookkeeping helped emerge from Dark Ages
- First paper money was warehouse receipts
- Credit cards evolved from merchant cards to universal systems
- Regulation often lags innovation (15-20 years for credit card regulations)

10. Bitcoin Context:
- Addresses peer-to-peer money movement without central authority
- Functions as a transaction ledger
- Builds on historical concepts of ledgers and money
- Combines technological innovation with traditional monetary concepts

Learning Implications:

1. Technical Understanding:
- Focus on fundamentals before applications
- Understand both ledger systems and monetary theory
- Grasp the relationship between traditional and digital currencies

2. Historical Perspective:
- Money evolves with technology and social needs
- Innovation often precedes regulation
- Social consensus crucial for monetary systems

3. Practical Applications:
- Consider both technical and social aspects when developing blockchain solutions
- Understand the role of ledgers in financial systems
- Remember the importance of adoption and trust in monetary systems

This lecture provides essential context for understanding how blockchain and cryptocurrencies fit into the broader history of money and financial systems.
