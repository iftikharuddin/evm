# 5. Blockchain Basics & Transactions, UTXO and Script Code

Key Points Covered:

1. Transactions in Bitcoin:
- Every transaction has inputs (where money comes from) and outputs (where it goes)
- All Bitcoin originally comes from "coinbase" transactions (mining rewards)
- You can send to multiple people in one transaction
- You always need to send "change" back to yourself if you don't spend the exact amount

2. UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output):
- This is Bitcoin's way of tracking who has what money
- Currently about 54 million unspent transactions
- Half of these are so small ("dust") they're not worth spending due to fees
- Total of about 340 million transactions in Bitcoin's history

3. Bitcoin's Scripting:
- Bitcoin has a simple programming language for transactions
- It's intentionally limited (not "Turing complete") for security
- Allows for basic conditions like:
  - Time locks (can't spend until a certain time)
  - Multi-signature requirements
  - Basic transaction rules

4. Interesting Technical Points:
- Miners have to wait 100 blocks before spending their rewards
- The first Bitcoin block contained a message about bank bailouts
- Miners can include small messages in coinbase transactions
- Some transactions require multiple signatures to spend

5. Common Questions Addressed:
- Why transactions take 10 minutes (for security/confirmation)
- How mining differs from regular transactions
- What makes Bitcoin novel (combining existing technologies in a new way)

The professor emphasized that while these technical details might seem like "eating broccoli" (not very exciting), they're fundamental to understanding how Bitcoin and other blockchain systems work.

Fun fact from the lecture: They ended with a class discussion about who Satoshi Nakamoto might be, with suggestions ranging from the NSA to various cryptographers, though no definitive answer exists!
