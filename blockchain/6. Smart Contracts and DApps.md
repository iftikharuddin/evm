# Smart Contracts & DApps

The lecture featured both Professor Gary Gensler and guest lecturer Professor Lawrence Lessig from Harvard Law School discussing smart contracts, their technological foundations, and legal implications.

## Technological Overview:
- Smart contracts are sets of promises specified in digital form that include protocols and automated execution
- Originated with Nick Szabo who coined the term in 1996
- Often called "dumb contracts" because they're simply algorithms, not truly intelligent

## Ethereum vs. Bitcoin:
- Ethereum was designed by Vitalik Buterin specifically for smart contracts
- Uses account-based ledgers rather than Bitcoin's transaction-based approach
- Is Turing-complete, meaning it can run complex programs
- Currently uses proof-of-work consensus like Bitcoin, though plans to move to proof-of-stake
- Has multiple Merkle trees for different aspects of state changes
- Has a more flexible monetary policy that has been changed several times

## Competing Platforms:
- EOS, which raised $4.2 billion and set up a $1 billion venture fund
- NEO, sometimes called "Ethereum of China"
- Various other alternatives with different consensus mechanisms

## Decentralized Applications (DApps):
- Most DApps have very limited usage (top DApp only had 1,500 users in 24 hours)
- Many issue their own tokens through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)
- ICOs have raised over $20 billion, but many projects fail within months

## Legal Perspective (Lessig):
- Smart contracts may not be legally binding contracts in traditional sense
- The state is always present in contracts, determining which are enforceable
- Smart contracts can benefit areas with:
  1. Weak legal systems by providing technical infrastructure for enforcement
  2. High transaction cost contracts by automating execution
- Contract ambiguity can be valuable - forcing all terms to be explicit can increase costs
- Technology and law often clash when code enables behaviors counter to legal intent

## Future Implications:
- May democratize legal services by automating routine contracts
- Could increase trust through verifiable execution and transparent records
- Will require courts and lawyers to develop technical literacy
- May create new regulatory challenges similar to derivatives markets

The lecture highlighted both the potential of smart contracts to reduce transaction costs and expand markets, while emphasizing that they will always operate within broader legal frameworks that cannot be escaped.
