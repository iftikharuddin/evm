# EVM

This repository documents my journey learning about the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), focusing on:
- Core implementation details
- Low-level architecture
- Inner workings and execution flow

I'll also be studying and sharing insights about recent EIPs, particularly focusing on the upcoming Pectra hardfork (Prague + Electra).

Feel free to explore and learn along with me!
